🌟 About Me
-----------

I’m Himmet Toprak Kesgin. (That's what I was told.)

💼 Experience
-------------

I don't like working in the private sector, but I completed the following internships to fulfill academic requirements:

* **2019 - Erlab Teknoloji:** (Intern) Training about RESTful Web API
    
* **2019 - TÜBİTAK BİLGEM:** (Intern) Path Planner with Genetic Algorithm and A* algorithm as part of a larger simulation system
    
* **2019 - YTU CE NLP Lab:** (Intern) Research on word embeddings
    
* **2021 - Today:** Research Assistant
    
    * Yildiz Technical University, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics, Computer Engineering
    (I'm not like Diogenes yet.)

🎓 Education
------------

* **2010 - 2014:** Afyon Anatolian High School (76/100)
    
    * (In our university entrance system, they add your high school grades to your exam scores. With my humble 76/100, I was practically giving everyone else an advance since everyone else is 95+)
* **2015 – 2016:** Yildiz Technical University, Department of Foreign Languages
    
    * (Learned English from scratch this year, proving you can indeed teach an old dog new tricks)
* **2016 – 2020:** Yildiz Technical University, Computer Engineering
    
    * (University entrance degree: 1 out of 93 people. It sounds like a good thing, but if you think about it, you realize I missed the next higher university by 1 person. If you also consider the high school score, meh)
    * GPA: 3.30 / 4.0 (Computer Science Courses A, Hardware Courses C)
* **2020 - 2022:** Yildiz Technical University, Computer Engineering (Master’s Degree)
    
    * GPA: 4.0 / 4.0 (online education 🙂)
* **2022 - Today:** Yildiz Technical University, Computer Engineering (PhD)
    
    * GPA: 4.0 / 4.0 (I was lucky in two final exams where I had a 50-50 chance)

🛠️ Skills
--------------------

* **Languages:** Turkish (Native), English (YOKDIL: 93,75) (The local English test only measures reading comprehension and grammar. I still use online translate to read when available.)

* **Coding:** Python (magic wand) (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Huggingface, any computer automation), Java (good for learning OOP, but I prefer Python), C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js (finished a few Jack Sparrow Udemy courses, able to launch local server and never used it. Good for UI though.), Prolog (I recommend it, it opens horizons), Perl (used for an assignment), MATLAB (used for an assignment), And dozens more (used for an assignment) C (the language I started programming with and recommend), 8086 Assembly (It's hard but should be seen)
    
* **Other:** Linux (I use it when there is something I cannot be able to run in Window.), GitHub-Git (I got excited more than ten times but never actually used it.)
    

📚 Papers
---------

We write papers, sometimes pay to publish, and readers even pay to read—can someone explain the logic? Why aren't we all just uploading our works to arXiv to let time and the community sort them out? Truly, why? Moreover, the slow pace of the publishing process and personal biases in peer review often play a larger role in determining the fate of our scholarly endeavors than the actual merit of the work itself. It often feels less like a measure of scholarly merit and more like a game of academic roulette. Why do we play it?

* **2019:** Bankruptcy Risk Forecast Based on Company Balance Sheet Data Using Machine Learning (My advisor wanted me to write a paper within the project scope and introduced me to scientific publications, but ordinary conference paper)
* **2022:** Development and Comparison of Scoring Functions in Curriculum Learning (Ordinary conference paper)
* **2022:** Investigating Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms in Text Datasets (Ordinary conference paper)
* **2023:** Iterative Mask Filling: An Effective Text Augmentation Method Using Masked Language Modeling (It does text augmentation using BERT's mask prediction feature. It's not very good but it has potential.)
* **2023:** Cyclical Curriculum Learning (The same dataset and model. Results are better when you use this instead of classical training (model.fit()). It really works and is also my master thesis)
* **2023:** Developing and Evaluating Tiny to Medium-Sized Turkish BERT Models (BERT models in Turkish, 5 years delayed)
* **2024:** Advancing NLP Models with Strategic Text Augmentation: A Comprehensive Study of Augmentation Methods and Curriculum Strategies (Cyclical Curriculum Learning results are surprisingly good, I have checked several times.)
* **2024:** A Robust Optimization Method for Label Noisy Datasets Based on Adaptive Threshold: Adaptive-k (Zero-cost training for label-noisy datasets, no extra model, no 2nd training, no hyperparameters, near-noiseless performance)
* **2024** Introducing cosmosGPT: Monolingual Training for Turkish Language Models (Turkish gpt2 models from scratch 5-6 years delayed.)

🧠 Interests
------------

* Artificial, Ancient, and Natural Intelligence
* Radical Candor and Honesty (If sincerity is absent so is everything else)
* Natural Language Processing (ChatGPT, LLM)
* Mathematics (The Proofs I Actually Understand)
* Probability and Statistics (Monte Carlo is really good)
* Reinforcement Learning (so fun but hard to code)
* Chess (1800 lichess, 1.e4 best by test, team Nepo)
* Philosophy (Stoicism, Skepticism, somewhere I see a grain of truth)
* Anything to entertain the mind or increase understanding (Irony, Wit, Paradox, Sarcasm, Satire, Humor (Dark), Recontextualisation, implicit understanding)
* As a movie Thriller and mystery, as a series sit-com, as a one-man show stand-up
* Every 2 weeks, spending 16+ hours a day on something (lectures, courses, books, youtube, entertainment).

🎯 Goals
------------
* The samurai has no goal, only path. (Why ruin it with an ending)

🛡️ Heroes
------------
* The more heroes we have, the less we think.

🌐 Ideology
------------
* Not any kind, to best of my efford.

😟 Worries
------------
* ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer.

------------
None. Except for anonymous accounts I use to look at memes.

Diogenes when asked letters of recommendation:

> When he sees the kind of man you are, he will understand. If he has the ability to distinguish between good and evil, he will know whether you are good or bad. However, if he doesn't already understand these concepts, writing a thousand letters to him will still not make him understand.
